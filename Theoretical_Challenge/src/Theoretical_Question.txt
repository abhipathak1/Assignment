1. How will you tackle the challenge above?

 I've approached the challenge by first reading data from the input CSV file,
 then evaluating formulas and storing results, printing the results to the console,
 and finally writing the results to the output CSV file.
 
 
2. What type of errors you would you check for?
 
I've included error handling for file I/O operations, 
such as reading from the input CSV file and writing to the output CSV file.
Additionally, I've added error handling for potential exceptions when parsing integers from the input data.


3. How might a user break your code?

Users might mess up the program by giving bad file paths,
unreadable files, or incorrect CSV formats.
