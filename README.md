## Features

- **Fetch API Data by Category**: Retrieve a list of public APIs filtered by a specific category.
- **Add New API Entries**: Simulate adding new API entries to the system. (Note: This feature does not actually post data to the public APIs database).

### 1. Fetching APIs by Category

To get a list of APIs by a specific category, use this endpoint:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/byCategory?category=Anime
```

### 2. Adding a New API Entry

To simulate adding a new API entry, use this endpoint:

```
POST http://localhost:8080/AddEntry
```

Note: It runs on port 8080, so adjust accordingly if needed.
